This is a project on AirBnB clone - The console

Description of the command interpreter:

Starting the Interpreter:

To start the AirBnB command interpreter, you'll need to run the Python file that contains the AirbnbCmd class. Once the file is running, the command interpreter will start automatically.

Using the Interpreter:

The AirBnB command interpreter allows you to manage objects in your AirBnB clone. You can create, show, update, and delete objects using the commands provided.

The general syntax for using the command interpreter is: command [class_name] [id] [attribute_name] [attribute_value]

Where command is the name of the command you want to run, class_name is the name of the class you want to operate on (e.g., User, Place, etc.), id is the ID of the object you want to operate on, attribute_name is the name of an attribute of the object, and attribute_value is the new value for the attribute.

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

create User: Creates a new user and saves it to the database.
create Place: Creates a new place and saves it to the database.
show User 1: Shows the details of user with ID 1.
update User 1 first_name "John": Updates the first name of user with ID 1 to "John".
destroy User 1: Deletes the user with ID 1 from the database.
These are just a few examples of the commands you can use in the AirBnB command interpreter. You can find more commands by typing help in the command prompt.
